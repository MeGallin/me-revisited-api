<p>I am currently working on an app that will display various sports news and updates. At this point in time I have focused mainly on F1, motoGP and Rugby.
I used NODEJS and EXPRESS to create the endpoint and REACTJS on the frontend.
Keep an eye open for the completed project.
It will be an amazing source of sports news and updates.
I have always been passionate about sports and I'm excited to put my skills to use in creating this app.
 I am confident that my knowledge of coding and my enthusiasm for sports will make this project a success.</p>
